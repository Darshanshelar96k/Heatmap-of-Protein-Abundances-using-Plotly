# Heatmap-of-Protein-Abundances-using-Plotly
This Python script generates an interactive heatmap for visualizing protein abundance data from an Excel file. The heatmap, created using Plotly, displays raw abundance values across different conditions. It's designed to handle large datasets efficiently, offering a zoomable and hoverable interface for data exploration.
